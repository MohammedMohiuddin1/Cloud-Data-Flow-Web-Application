### Sensitive Information Notice

I have intentionally excluded the actual code from this repository because it contains sensitive connection strings and access keys that are critical to the security of my cloud account. Sharing these details publicly could expose my account to unauthorized access, data breaches, or misuse of resources.  

To maintain security and adhere to best practices, all credentials are securely stored and kept private.  

If you're interested in learning more about the project and how it works, please refer to the **Mohammed M CSS436 Program 4 Report** attached to this repository or email me at mmuzm786@gmail.com.  

Thank you!
